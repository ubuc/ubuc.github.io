We are a very active club and offer a range of activities to suit your interests and abilities. We provide training from beginner to experienced diver levels. We also run multiple trips throughout the year, from day events to week-long expeditions. We especially encourage aspiring Dive Leaders to organise their own trips. Freediving is not one of the major activites of the club, however events are run on an one-off basis, providing there are enough people interested. We are also a friendly and sociable bunch! Our dedicated Events Manager runs most of our social events, including diving talks, boat pub crawls, trips, and much more! Anyone, however, can organise an event.

## Scuba Diving Training

We offer extensive training for SCUBA diving, anywhere from beginner to advanced diver levels. We teach using the standards of our diving agency BSAC. We provide training for the following qualifications:

*    Ocean Diver
*    Sports Diver
*    Dive Leader

Training is divided into classroom lectures and pool training, both of which are conveniently held in the Students' Union. At Easter we run a trip to Porthkerris (Cornwall) to complete the open water training. There are opportunities for additional open water training throughout the year, and this often involves weekend trips to quarries nearby.

In addition, we run Skills Development Courses (SDCs). These include:

*    Boat Handling
*    Oxygen Administration & Basic Life Support
*    Nitrox Blending

## Scuba Diving Trips

UBUC runs regular diving trips in the local region, as well as annual expeditions to the UK and abroad. Our frequent dive spots include:

*    Torquay
*    Brixham
*    Plymouth
*    Chesil Cove (Weymouth)
*    Porthkerris (Cornwall)
*    Skomer (Wales)
*    Cromhall, Chepstow & Vobster quarries

We also try to organise an annual expedition-type trip that focuses on diving rather than training. Our expedition trips have taken to Scotland, Skomer and the Farne Islands among other places. This trip usually takes place during the University's summer break

Finally, we also organise overseas trips on a one-off basis. These are generally more expensive, but they are worth it! In January 2014 and 2015 we travelled to the Red Sea, the divers' heaven. This year we are looking into running more trips abroad.
Freediving

Freediving courses are run on a one-off basis, usually once a year by inviting external instructors. Provided you have an AIDA 1* qualification (which can be obtained through attending the course) you can train during our normal training sessions with a buddy of similar qualification.

If you are interested in Freediving, contact the committee to find out more.

At the moment we do not organise exclusive freediving trips.

## Socials

Socials are just as important as diving and we regularly organise nights out as a club. We also run the infamous boat crawl each year, taking the boats down Bristol habour while sampling the bars along the way. Feel free to join us or put forward suggestions to our Social Secs.
