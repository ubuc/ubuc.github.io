Founded in 1960, the UBUC has a long history of providing an affordable, friendly and exciting diving experience to all. Over the years, UBUC has grown to around 100 members ranging from new trainees to seasoned divers whose expertise is vital to the smooth running of the club. From complete beginner to advanced diver the club has something for everyone, providing the opportunity to expand upon your experience, gain new qualifications and most importantly explore the exciting underwater world, both in the UK and abroad.

Our facilities and training pool are located in the Student's Union. Our stores are situated in the underground car park. You can find us in the White Harte just off Park Street every Tuesday from 8:00pm.

One of our main goals is to provide affordable scuba diving training. Every year we train around 30 divers and provide a number of international qualifications from beginner to advanced diver levels. We are affiliated to the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC), and therefore issue qualifications according to BSAC standards. Over the past few years, we have gained a number of BSAC awards recognising our achievements in training.

Every year we organise a number of trips, both in the UK and abroad. Whether it's wrecks, reefs of wildlife, you'll find something to float your boat!

The club is overseen by 11 committee members. However, being such an active club means we rely on help from everyone to organise trips, help with equipment maintenance and assist with training. We strive to keep costs as low as possible, but please be aware this is an equipment-intensive activity and we can provide you with most of the kit you will need.
